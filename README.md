# muon-detector-tools

This repository contains a Python-based detector script for identifying cosmic ray muons in images taken by an astronomical optical instrument. Cosmic ray muons are particles produced by high-energy cosmic rays colliding with Earthâ€™s atmosphere. This project includes sample data and a Jupyter notebook to help you get started with detecting them.
